# WIKIPEDIA-FETCHER-API
>Developed a platform to query over wikipedia. API can help to get basic
information for any query. Results can be served in two formats as JSON as
well as HTML format.
> Spring MVC was used for serving in the backend. Backend process involves
calling wikipedia.org to fetch raw data, which is eventually parsed and cleaned
to get the output.
> Tested the project for 300+ queries like “India”, “America”, “Obama” etc.
